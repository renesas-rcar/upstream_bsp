R-Car H3 ES1.x
	- R-Car H3 ES1.x was only available to an internal development group and
	  needed a lot of quirks and workarounds. These become a maintenance
	  burden now, so our development group decided to remove upstream support
	  for this SoC.

CAN-FD
	- Channel 0 on White-Hawk uses an NXP TJR1443AT CAN transceiver, which
	  must be enabled through a GPIO.  Support for that is added through
	  the phy-can-transceiver driver, and by adding transceiver support to
	  the rcar-canfd driver.

CPUidle
	- Disabling CPUidle on M3ULCB was ignored:
	  a7afdde5f202 arm64: dts: renesas: r8a77960-ulcb: Disable CPUIdle support for CA53
	  Is this needed? If yes, why not for r8a77960-salvator-x{,s}.dts?
	  Perhaps this should be handled in drivers/cpuidle/cpuidle-psci.c instead, cfr.

Media
	- All panel DTS additions have been ignored. Panels must be supported upstream via DT overlays.

RISC-V
	- This tree includes latest RISC-V support for Renesas RZ/Five.

RPC-IF
	- enabling 'burst read' has been dropped from the BSP (1b212c753d0c memory: renesas-rpc-if: Use burst read operation).
	  The patch is incomplete and may break.
	  There is a task to upstream it, but it needs time for research and a more complete solution

Sound
	- V4H White-Hawk sound is supported by DT overlay.
	  upstream doesn't support this, but you can make the same things as before by this.

		dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_R8A779G0) += r8a779g0-white-hawk-with-sound-da7212.dtb
		r8a779g0-white-hawk-with-sound-da7212-dtbs = r8a779g0-white-hawk.dtb r8a779g0-white-hawk-ard-audio-da7212.dtbo

	- V4H White-Hawk on BSP needed to setup PWM from user-space,
	  but it is no longer needed.

	- It might have aplay/arecord interface even though it doesn't have settings
	  on DT (= playback/capture). This BSP has fixed it. Thus, ULCB+KF pcm3168a capture
	  interface was changed (= arecord -D plughw:0,2 -> plughw:0,1)

	- Upstream is already supporting TDM on ulcb-kf pcm3168a.
	  BSP is assuming that pcm3168a can handle Playback/Capture on same DAI,
	  but it is wrong. pcm3168a is not symmetric device (playback 8ch vs capture 6ch).

	- BSP is tring to use each codecs as different Sound Card (ak4613/pcm3168a/si468x/wl18xx),
	  but it is wrong. These should be handled on the same Card.
	  Otherwise it will get error, like below
		[    2.533890] rcar_sound ec500000.sound: Trying to bind component to card "pcm3168a" but is already bound to card "ak4613"
		[    2.544950] asoc-audio-graph-card sound@1: ASoC: failed to instantiate card -19

Linux with other OS

	- If Linux is worked with other OS, Linux might kill device power which is used on other OS.
	  Linux will ignore such device if DT has status = "reserved".

	"reserved"
		Indicates that the device is operational, but should not be
		used. Typically this is used for devices that are controlled
		by another software component, such as platform firmware.

	ex)
		devicce@xxxx {
			...
			status = "reserved";
		};
