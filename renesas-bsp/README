=============================================

* Before commit

	Let's run sanity-check before commit.
	No report is required

		> renesas-bsp/script/sanity-check.sh

* Todo
	Core
		- BSP is using many "ebisu-xxx" dts, but upstream has only "ebisu".
		  We can remove these from "remains", and explain about it on "comment"
		- Let's accept "defconfig" update patch even though it was local patch.

* Task
	1) Backport/Handle each "remains" patches on latest renesas-bsp-rebase-v6.1
	2) Update comment/handled/ignored/remains files accordingly
	3) Push it to your git repository, and indicate it. Morimoto will merge it.
	4) back to 1)

* How to handle V3U patch ?

	BSP team is still using V3U, let's keep it.

* How to handle *upportable* patch ?

	If the patch can be upstreamed, but is now trying to,
	let's apply the patch, and remove it from "remains".
	The patch can be replaced if the patch was accepted on upstream.

	Let's add it to bsp61x-*.yaml

* How to handle *real* local patch ?

	Remove it from "remains" file, and add it on "ignored" file
	with reason.

	Please find and use last part of "remains" for now.

	These non-upstreamable commits will be handled by BSP team.

* Schedule

	I could connect to BSP team. The time limit is "End of Feb".

	~ Jan/E
		- focus "backportable" patches
			- From linus or linux-next branches
		- focus "defconfig update" patches
			- let's accept defconfig update patch even though
			  it was local patch
		- focus "upportable" patches
			- This means, it is still local patch, but can be upported.
			  Please apply such patch, and remove it from remain file.
			  And try to upport it. We can replace it if upport has done.
		- pickup *real* local patch
			- and move it to "ignored" file.

	~ Feb/E
		- aggressive backport (if needed)
		- finalize

	Every Friday
		I will ask latest git every Friday, and merge it at next Monday.
		But please don't hesitate to say "did nothing, because of SoW",
		we never complain about it. We don't know when you are working for Renesas.
