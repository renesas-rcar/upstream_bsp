* About BSP rebase

	Upstream team rebased BSP v5.2.0-rcX (Linux Kernel v5.10.147 base)
	to Linux Kernel v6.1.X. Rebased BSP structure is like below.

		(C) xxxxx BSP rebase work on v6.1.X
		 ^  xxxxx ...
		 |  xxxxx local patches which is/will posted to upstream ML
		(B) xxxxx local patches from previous BSP
		 |  xxxxx backported patches from latest Linux
		 v
		(A) xxxxx v6.1.X

	(A) is base kernel (= LTS v6.1.X)
	(B) are BSP additional patches (backport, etc)
	(C) is information from Upstream team.

	(C) is for BSP team, but not for customer.
	Please remove (C) commit when BSP team uses this rebased BSP.
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	(C) is including below

		${LINUX}/renesas-bsp

* Original BSP commits

	It has list of target BSP commits since v5.10.147 kernel.
	BSP team need to handle the commits by themself which was added on top
	of it *after* Upstream's rebase work if exist.
	Please see below

		${LINUX}/renesas-bsp/full

* Handled commits / ignored commits

	Upstream team has been trying to upport BSP local patches,
	thus many of these patches are now upstreamed.
	We can categorize previous BSP commits into below

		(1) upstreamed, and included in LTS v6.1.X.
		(2) upstreamed, and included in latest Linux kernel.
		(3) not yet upstreamed.
		(4) ignored.

	We did nothing (1) patches because it is already included on base
	kernel (= LTS v6.1.X).
	We backported (2) patches into this rebased BSP. Each commit has
	"cherry picked from" tag.
	We are trying to upport (3) patches, thus it is not yet included.
	you can see which one was so in "remains" file.

	But, we ignored (4) patches, because these are..

		(4.1) BSP specific patch which is not possible to upport
		(4.2) It is not accepable in upstream
		(4.3) It is wrong solution
		(4.4) We don't have the board / can't test

	BSP team need to handle (4) patches by themself.

	You can see which commit was included, which commit was ignored,
	and some comments from Upstream team.
	Please see below

		${LINUX}/renesas-bsp/comment : (1)/(2)/(3)
		${LINUX}/renesas-bsp/handled : (1)/(2)
		${LINUX}/renesas-bsp/remains : (3)
		${LINUX}/renesas-bsp/ignored : (4)

* About handled CVE

	Upstream team knows that sometimes BSP team is asked about supported CVE from
	customer. Rebase BSP has support CVE list to support BSP team.
	It comes from CIP project.

	Please see below

* defconfig vs renesas_defconfig

	Upstream team recommend to use "renesas_defconfig" instead of customized defconfig.
	"renesas_defconfig" doesn't have unrelated configs, and is using "=y" for all configs.
