**Note:**
- Kernel LTS v6.6 doesn't support:
  - PCIe and TSN driver for V4H White Hawk Single
  - CAN_FD with speed 5M (Kernel v6.6 is too old to backport patch "can: rcar_canfd: Add support for Transceiver Delay Compensation" which is used to support CAN-FD with dbitrate 5Mbps)
- Please contact to duy.nguyen.rh@renesas.com if you need to know test results more details.
